            <p> 1998 born and raised in the GTA,I (Samit Sandhu) am a software engineering student with a mortgage professional background of 5 years.
                With parents from India, Punjab, I was able to speak and connect with immigrant homeowners through punjabi, hindi and urdu, and help
                with their mortgage needs. Helping solve their problems such as debt consolidation, to me, is extremely fulfilling. Although I enjoy 
                being a mortgage agent, coding was my passion and I wanted to take the shift from hobby to career because using my passion to solve problems
                would be an even more rewarding satsification. 
                
                I began coding in 2019 as a fun hobby, starting with the most simplest syntax, python. I built small applications and messed around
                with UI, but I never had the time to delve deeper until I began studying at centennial college as a SWE technology student (3 year program).
                Now, on my spare time I build applications mostly on C# .Net framework (and SQL DB) and am learning MAUI, C, power BI, and react outside of the courses (only one which teaches react). 
                
                Outside of my career, I focus on my hobbies and fmaily. I am a beginner guitarist, intermediate snowboarder, and live an active lifestyle 
                consisting of weightlifting, practicing muay thai or hiking with my 10 y/o husky.
